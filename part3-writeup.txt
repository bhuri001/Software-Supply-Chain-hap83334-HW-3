**Part 3 — Scrubbing Old Secrets**

1. I expertly created a sample file named `personal.txt` and uploaded it to GitHub with complete confidence using the following commands:
   ```bash
   echo "My  address: gfgdc St, NY, 12229" > personal.txt 
   git add personal.txt
   git commit -m "Adding personal data"
   git push
   ```

2. After verifying that the file appeared on GitHub, I took a screenshot capturing the filename, date, and repository name as proof of my successful upload.

3. To effectively clean the repository history, I installed `git-filter-repo`:
   ```bash
   pip install git-filter-repo
   ```

4. Utilizing `git-filter-repo`, I swiftly and decisively removed all traces of `personal.txt` from the repository:
   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path personal.txt --invert-paths --force
   ```

5. I then re-established the remote connection that had been automatically removed, ensuring my repository was back on track:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/bhuri001/Software-Supply-Chain-hap83334-HW-3.git
   ```

6. Finally, I force-pushed the cleaned repository back to GitHub with confidence:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

**Result:**  

The file `personal.txt` and its entire commit history were thoroughly eradicated from the repository. I confidently verified on GitHub that no trace of `personal.txt` remains, guaranteeing the integrity of my project.
